# Assignment 3 Repository

## Computer Vision and Image Processing 

The purpose of this repository is to preserve a computer vision assignment associated with keypoint detection.
Keypoints are spots in an image that have a high importance. Crucially, keypoints are parts of an image that can be identified regardless of how an image is distorted. This is uesful in enterprises including depth estimation. In this assignment, I use a SIFT-FLANN pipeline to identify and match key features in four images with differing levels of difficulty.
